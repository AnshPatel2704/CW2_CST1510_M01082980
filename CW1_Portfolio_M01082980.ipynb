    "My learning experience throughout the first six weeks of **CST1510: Programming for Data Communication and Networks** is explained in this portfolio. I have gained an excelent and lots of extra understanding of the foundational concepts of Python programming throughout this 5 week, including variables, data types, conditional statements, loops, functions, modules, string manipulation, and try-except structures for managing errors more frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "I gained practical experience from the labs hours and exercises that improved my ability to solve problems and think logically. Because, they showed how the theoretical concepts might be applied to actual data handling and network-related issues, I especially enjoyed working on the string manipulation, password validation, and binary conversion projects which is hard for me to understand but still able to do it a little bit and in futre able to do it proffesionlly.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the biggest obstacles I had to overcome was learning how to effectively organize my code and deal with unforeseen mistakes. But regular practice and debugging gave me the confidence I needed to write clear, understandable, and error-free code.\n",

    "All things considered, this portfolio demonstrates my development as a beginner developer who can now create, construct, and test Python programs that address real-world issues relevant to network and data communication systems."

    "\n",
    "• Then i used Comments (**#**)  to describe each section and make the program easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "• In **PART 2**, i used **print()** function to show the collected information back to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "• After that i user escape character like **\\n** to add a **new line** before displaying the user information, making the output cleaner and easy to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Then i used another escape character **\\t** to add **tab spaces**, which helps format the output neatly.\n",
    "\n",
    "• The **+ operator** is used for **string concatenation**, meaning it joins the text labels with the user’s entered values.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Overall, the program follows a simple flow which is Collect input and Display output\n"

    "During this task, I focused on understanding the basic structure of **Python Programming**. The main goal was to learn how to collect **user input** and display it in a **clear and organised format**. This involved using core features of Python, including taking **input**, storing values inside **variables**, and printing formatted **output**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, I used the **input()** function multiple times to gather different pieces of information from the user, such as their **name**, **interest**, **nationality**, **course**, and **programming experience**. After collecting the data, I applied the **print()** function to display the details back to the user. This helped me understand how information flows from **user entry** to **program output**.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also used escape characters like **\\n** and **\\t** to make the output more **readable and structured**. These formatting tools allowed me to create **spacing** and **alignment** for better presentation. Additionally, I used the **string concatenation operator (+)** to combine **text labels** with the values entered by the user. This gave me practical experience in handling **strings** and formatting text dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program was divided into two clear parts: **collecting input** and **displaying output**. Adding **comments** helped me break down the structure, making the code easier to understand for both myself and future readers.\n",

    "Completing this task allowed me to practise essential programming skills, including **data input**, **variable handling**, **string formatting**, and **output presentation**. These **foundational concepts** are important, as they are commonly used in **real-world applications**. By mastering these **basic techniques**, I am building a strong base to support my future learning in **Python** and other programming areas.\n",

    "\n",
    "• The program checks if the input contains only digits using **isdigit()**.  \n",

    "• Only **positive numbers** (greater than 0) are accepted.  \n",

    "While working on this program, I found that **Python** continues to be a very beginner-friendly language. Its syntax is clear and simple, which made writing the **while True loop** and using **if statements** feel natural. I appreciated that Python does not require semicolons or complicated grammar, so I could focus on understanding the logic rather than the formatting.\n",
    "\n",

    "I also used the **.isdigit()** method to check whether the user entered a valid number. This was helpful because the program needed to accept only positive numbers and reject invalid inputs. Additionally, I learned how to use the **modulus operator (%)** to determine whether a number is even by checking the remainder after division. This allowed the program to detect the first even number from the list.\n",

    "\n",

    "- After creating the file, I used a **try-except block** to read from it.  \n",
    "  - `try:` attempts to open the file in read mode (`\"r\"`) and read all lines.  \n",
    "  - Each line is processed with **`strip()`** to remove newline characters and stored in a **list** called `clothing_list`.  \n",
    "  - If the file does not exist, the **`except FileNotFoundError`** block prints an error message and sets `clothing_list` to an empty list.  \n",

    "- To remove duplicates, I converted the list into a **set** using `set(clothing_list)`.  \n",
    "  - Sets are Python **data structures** that store only unique items.  \n",
